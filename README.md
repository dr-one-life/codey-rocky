[Codey Rocky](https://www.makeblock.com/steam-kits/codey-rocky) python scripts

***Please note: the files only contain Python scripts, no Scratch blocks!***

[Tetris.mblock](/Tetris.mblock) is a minified version of the old Tetris game.
Use the A and B buttons to move the block and the C button to rotate it or to restart the game.
You can also tilt Codey left and right to rotate the block.

[Snake.mblock](/Snake.mblock) is the good old Snake game.
Use the A and B buttons to change the snake direction and the C button to stop/restart the game.

[Weather.mblock](/Weather.mblock) is a good example of IoT - it shows weather forecast using data from the OpenWeatherMap REST API. You will have to register on the [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/) web page in order to get an API key. A free of charge subscription allows you to make up to 1000 calls per day or up to 60 calls per minute.
Finally you have to enter settings for your WiFi network access, API KEY and your GPS location in the mblock file.

***Have fun!*** :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
