[Codey Rocky](https://www.makeblock.com/steam-kits/codey-rocky) python scripts

***Please note: the files only contain Python scripts, no Scratch blocks!***

[Tetris.mblock](/Tetris.mblock) is a minified version of the old Tetris game.
Use the A and B buttons to move the figure and the C button to rotate it or to restart the game.
In addition you can tilt Codey left and right to rotate the figure.

[Snake.mblock](/Snake.mblock) is the good old Snake game.
Use the A and B buttons to change the snake direction and the C button to stop/restart the game.

***Have fun!*** :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
